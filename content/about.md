I’m Liam Symonds, a software engineer, technical lead and architect (the software kind) living in Norfolk, England.

I’ve been a ‘full stack’ software engineer professionally for years now. I started creating (awful) websites when I was 7 years old, moved onto PHP development a few years after that and got relatively good at developing software some time later. Now-a-days, I’m language and framework agnostic and pick the best tool for the job; but will favor C# on the server side if it is fit for the task at hand.

I'm available for advice, consulting work and a general chat. Hit me up through email at hello@liamsymonds.com.
